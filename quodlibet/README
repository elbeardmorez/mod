the algorithm for construction of a final 'query to send'  based on user
input is imperfect. allow users to override this if the results are off
(e.g. missing words) whilst giving them insight into what's usually best.

-the current engine defaults of 5 and 3 for Amazon and Discogs respectively
 occassionally aren't enough to see the actual cover you want. this
 change allows for more results
-new overriding results limit takes the lower of current defaults - 3
-REQUEST_LIMIT_MAX is hardcoded as 15 so users can't do anything too crazy
-breaking change as it causes all engines to use the same user defined  limit

-adds XPaned base with H/V subclasses
-adds Multi XPaned H/V subclasses of MultiPaned
-implementation based on a single pane of 'x'-pane being set as
expandable. work is then done to ensure that pane takes any space given
by collapsed expanders, or resized panes
-PaneLock objects are embedded into widgets who want to lock their own
size during (necessarily) chaotic resizing operations
-fixing sizes manually AND allowing for manual resizing is difficult.
setting size requests locks the minimum pane sizes, which makes for
sensible resizing 'of the pane you'd expect to be resized', but doing so means
the panes cannot be made smaller. given the pane handle is unhookable in
any useful way (right down to the Gtk core), the 'nearly perfect'
workaround employed uses do_allocate_size to remove locks and button
releases to restore them. the unwanted result of this is that a resize
MUST start by making the pane at least 1px BIGGER, before making it
bigger OR smaller. in practice, this is not really noticable
