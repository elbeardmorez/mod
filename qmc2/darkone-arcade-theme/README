# qmc2 'darkone' arcade theme

## notes
-this work was accepted and committed upstream in r4926, and was part of the QMC2-0.39 release following many fixes and improvements

## installation (legacy)
-pull qmc2 rev 4925
-apply patches from the 'patch' dir
-copy 'images' folder from under this repo's 'binary' dir to 'QMC-SRC/arcade/qml/darkone/'
-build (make arcade)
-run (qmc2-arcade -theme darkone)

## documentation
-zooming is controlled by mouse-scroll over (most parts) of the cabinet image, or via the slider control in the preferences menu. note zooming is also affected by window resizing
-mouse-left-clicking the cabinet's little game start buttons or its grid, or the game button on the toolbar, or hitting keyboard-RET, will launch the currently selected title*
-mouse-double-left-clicking a title on the list will select and launch that title*
-the toolbar menu auto-hides by default*. position the mouse cursor on the botton few pixels of the window to unhide it
-double-left clicking the arcade screen will reveal the game data navigator
--navigate images / info with by mouse-left-clicking the arrows
--mouse-left-click on the buttons marked '1' or '2' to set the current data item (eg. 'preview') to be the primary / secondary source of display data
--mixing image and info data types as primary / secondary sources will result in text overlaying image
--info on the screen is scrollable by mouse-left-down followed by mouse-move (up/down), as is the game list
-if the 'flash effect' is enabled, you can hit keyboard-ESC to immediately back out of the pending game launch
-Keyboard-Ctrl-q quits the application

*not when the preferences menu is open
**not when the FPS counter is enabled

## todo

-improve documentation?!
-enable scrollbar for info

## devs (legacy)
-tested solely with gnu/linux qt 4.8.4 / qtquick 1.1
-patch 'diff-r4925.diff' targets modified (existing) files
-patch 'add-r4925.diff' targets additional files
-infoprovider.cpp is a created pretty much entirely from qmc2-main.cpp chunks (ruthlessly stripped). i dislike the code duplication too, sorry
-imageprovider.cpp was modified out of necessity to test for success in retrieving a cached file. i tried to reduce the (existing) code duplication too
-the game list is loaded slightly later in this theme to ensure no reload is required should sort-by-name be set
-tweakedapplicationviewer's addition 'initialised' var was required to stop a full set of null settings being saved when the viewer failed to load. doubt any user would ever hit this
-the additional components were sourced from qt-components (licence intact) / qt-forums (generic samples)
-wheel.h/pointer.h are deprecated as of qt5. i looked at ways to implement both, but options are limited. push .qml through a pp or use multiple files
-there's an excessive amount of comments. i like comments
-thanks to the original authors for doing the hard work
