## devs
-tested solely with gnu/linux qt 4.8.4 / qtquick 1.1
-patch 'diff-r4925.diff' targets modified (existing) files
-patch 'add-r4925.diff' targets additional files
-infoprovider.cpp is a created pretty much entirely from qmc2-main.cpp chunks (ruthlessly stripped). i dislike the code duplication too, sorry
-imageprovider.cpp was modified out of necessity to test for success in retrieving a cached file. i tried to reduce the (existing) code duplication too
-the game list is loaded slightly later in this theme to ensure no reload is required should sort-by-name be set
-tweakedapplicationviewer's addition 'initialised' var was required to stop a full set of null settings being saved when the viewer failed to load. doubt any user would ever hit this
-the additional components were sourced from qt-components (licence intact) / qt-forums (generic samples)
-wheel.h/pointer.h are deprecated as of qt5. i looked at ways to implement both, but options are limited. push .qml through a pp or use multiple files
-there's an excessive amount of comments. i like comments
-thanks to the original author for doing the hard work
