[issue reported by Michael Zeilfelder]

-given the low level of development seen on this library, such a
restrictive SOVERSION is unnecessary. changes to ABI would usually
entail a bump at the MAJOR_VERSION level, not the BUILD_VERSION
level
-currently, cmake builds won't be a drop in replacement for consumers
of existing builds, who will be forced to rebuild whole applications
unnecessarily
