-Sieve regex rules are based on Posix which has no support for enhanced  
(Perl/Java) features such as lookarounds
-negating a complex regexp as would be made possible by this patch is
simpler than jumping through hoops by use of multiple rules
-Ingo appears to support the 'not regex' case for other backends
