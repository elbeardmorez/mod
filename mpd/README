# PulseOutputPlugin_.set.icon.name.diff [git sha:3a3fb98f79de9863e3d78f57bb254064a9de4b09 | committed]
-set icon name to 'mpd' so pavucontrol et al. can display an icon for the stream

# PulseOutputPlugin_.support.non-static.output.sinks.diff [git sha:e4849ff0ce7eed71ab6010f1ec98e3f2b9849ceb | rejected (superseded)]
-update default output sink on any change to the current stream's sink
-re-initialisation of audio output device, e.g. on player stop/start or
audio file format change, no longer results in reversion to statically
configured default sink
-revert to server-side choice of sink if connection to statically
configured default sink fails

# PulseOutputPlugin_.revert.sink.selection.to.pa.server.diff [git sha: 85d2bff82fba6829c99f93abc747fb62e01bc2e2 | pending]
-revert to pa server sink selection for the remainder of the session
when an output sink has been configured explicitly, and it is either
invalid, or movement of the mpd stream is detected

-protects against a configured sink which is removed during the
session resulting in no mpd playback until the same sink returns

-deals with the scenario where re-initialisation of the audio output
device (e.g. on player stop/start, or audio file format change) causes
an undesired reversion of the mpd stream to an explicitly configured
output sink when the stream has been moved elsewhere during the
session
