-don't replace a temporily nuked' module prematurely. ensure that
removed 'top_modules' stay removed until the complete compound path
has been searched for

fixes e.g. import_relative('io.input', '...trepan', '')

-ensure that modules for all successful searches are placed in the
'sys.modules' dictionary. previously, duplicate searches were made
for some non-compound imports

-cleanup code:
--bring the initial module search into 'fallback' loop to avoid code
duplication
--trim fat e.g. pass statements
--improve comments detailing the routine

-added (and left in) debug statements to ease trace comparisons
